# Social Media Data Analytics Project

This project involves helping a social media company better understand its user base & behavior on its platform.

The goal is to extract insights about the platform's user base, content interests, and engagement behavior.

If there are additional insights of interests to the company, they should also communicated.

Some additional info about the platform:

- The platform focuses on user anonymity by tracking user interactions on each piece of content instead of the user profiles themselves.

- They also provide users with over 100 different types of ‘reactions’ (or interactions) to engage with each piece of content.

- Each of the ‘reactions’ has a ranking score attached to it. The higher the score, the better.
